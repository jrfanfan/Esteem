# Overview

This program is an implementation of the Rosenberg
Self-Esteem Scale. This program will show you ten
statements that you could possibly apply to yourself.
Please rate how much you agree with each of the
statements by responding with one of these four letters.
It will then give the user their score based on their responses.
The scale ranges from 0-30. Scores between 15 and 25 are within normal range;
scores below 15 suggest low self-esteem.
